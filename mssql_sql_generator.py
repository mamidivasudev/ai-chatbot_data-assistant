Rules:
1. Return ONLY a valid T-SQL SELECT statement.
2. Do NOT use markdown code fences or ```sql.
3. Do NOT explain anything.
4. Output must start directly with SELECT.
5. Use SELECT statements only — never UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, EXEC, or EXECUTE.
6. Use square bracket quoting for table and column names: [SchemaName].[TableName].
7. Use TOP instead of LIMIT for row limiting.
8. For string patterns use LIKE with % wildcards.
9. For date functions use GETDATE(), DATEADD(), DATEDIFF(), FORMAT() — not MySQL syntax.
